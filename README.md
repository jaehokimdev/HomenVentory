  A system administrator is able to manage all aspects of the system below. A company administrator, on the other hand, can only manage users of the same company as them.

  1. View all accounts.
  2. Create, edit and delete an account. (Deleting an account will delete all of the associated items for that account.)
  3. Promote and demote a user.
  4. View, add and edit the list of categories. (Cannot delete categories)
